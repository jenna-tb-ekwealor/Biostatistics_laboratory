Transparency and reproducibility are key attributes of scientific
studies. In an effort to advance science across fields, primary
literature now needs to be accompanied by the data analyzed and the
analysis carried out. Because of this, *programming languages* have
become popular in science. They support easy work with data and allow us
to reproduce a statistical analysis in its entirety. Today, we will
explore the popular R programming language. We will be using R and its
integrated development environment, RStudio, to manage biological data
and address research questions with the goal to practice transparency
and reproducibility in statistical analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

In this lab, we will introduce R, a *programming language* and free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics. First
developed in the 1990s, R has become a popular tool among biologists in
recent years and nearly an essential skill among biology students,
supporting national calls to promote and enhance quantitative literacy.
In particular, the popularity of R in biology is partly due to its
quality as a statistical software and its ability to manage large
datasets. Besides being free, one can contribute to new functions and
many other tools within R that can be shared with the public. One of
these developments is *RStudio*, an integrated development environment
for R that makes it easier to navigate certain aspects of the language.
So, let's explore both R and RStudio and learn some of its basic
attributes and codes.


**Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to:**

-   Familiarize with the layout of RStudio;
-   Import data to R using RStudio;
-   Identify the structure of a data object;
-   Manage a data object by selecting and filtering columns;
-   Create a reproducible lab report in R Markdown.

-   lizards.csv

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## In-class activity

This example should work as a step-by-step introduction to some basic
skills you will be implementing in the following chapters. For this
activity, we will be using the dataset "anole.csv" from [Donihue et
al. 2018](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/6/1127/files/2018/12/Donihue-et-al.-2018-2e1xqw4.pdf).


### 1. Creating and setting a working directory

In your computer, create a folder named "working_directory" and save the
downloaded file "anole.csv" in it. Open RStudio. Go to the
Flies/Plots/Packages/Help window (usually in the bottom right pane) and search for your working_directory
folder in Files. This window in RStudio allows you to navigate folders
in your computer. Once in your working_directory folder, click the gear icon -\>
Set As Working Directory. **Note:** for R to read the files of interest,
you need to indicate where in your computer is the file (i.e., your
working directory).

Alternatively, you can go to Session (at the top) -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory.. and navigate to working_directory. 

### 2. Creating and saving your R script

An R script is where you will be saving your codes and the progress of
your work. The first step when carrying out a new analysis is to open a
new script and save it. We are going to be doing this in our custom "Lab Report" format. Download the file from Canvas and save it somewhere handy on your computer. This copy will serve as your template for each Lab this semester. 
Then, open it and File -> Save As with a useful name in your working_directory folder, with a .Rmd file extension. This is the copy you can work with for today's Lab Activity. 


### 3. Annotating your R script

Annotating your script is a very important step that helps you to keep
track of your work and facilitates reproducibility. The R script serves
as your notebook. There, you save your codes together with associated
annotations indicating what those codes are for. In your script, write a
description of the codes you will be employing in this activity. **Use a
"#" before any line of text you want R to interpret as an annotation and
not as code**. In Markdown, "#" also indicates a header. Click the "Knit" button at the top frequently to see how your document is looking. 

For example, in the beginning of this activity's script, you may add:

```r
# Chapter 1: Intro to R and RStudio
```

**Note:** Remember to do annotations before any line of code so that you
or others can understand the meaning of the code.


### 4. Importing data files to R using RStudio

There are several ways to import data to R using RStudio and it depends
on the type of file the data is (i.e., .csv, .RData). You may use the
one that works best for you. Below are three ways to import data:


- **A. Importing a .csv file using the RStudio drop down menu**: In the
Flies/Plots/Packages/Help window of RStudio, click File and search for
your working_directory folder. Once there, click on the anole.csv file
and import it using the drop down menu. If it worked, you should see
"anole.csv" in the RStudio Global Environment window.


- **B. Importing a .csv file using codes**: After setting up your working
directory (Step 1), use the function ```read.csv()``` to import the
anole.csv file. See the example below. Note the use of the commands
```header=TRUE``` in order to treat the first row of the data frame as a
header and ```stringsASFactors=TRUE``` to indicate that strings in the
data frame should be treated as factor variables.

```r
# importing the anole data
anole <- read.csv("anole.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
```

To run the line of codes, copy it and paste it in your R script. You may
highlight it and click "Run", which is located in the upper side of the
script. If it worked, you should see the line of codes in your console
and "anole.csv" in the RStudio Global Environment window.


- **C. Using an .RData file**: If the data file is an R object (file
extension = .RData), right click it and open it with RStudio. If it
worked, you should see "anole.csv" in the RStudio Global Environment window.




### 5. Exploring the imported dataset

Before any analysis, we first need to check the data and understand its
attributes.

Let's start looking into the structure of "anole.csv" by using the function
```str()```. This function gives us information about the *class* of the
data object (i.e., "anole.csv"), what *variables* are in the data object,
and how many *observations* we have in the data object.

```r
# data structure
str(anole)
```


### *Questions*

a.  *What is the class of the dataset "anole.csv" (e.g., data frame, table,
    tibble)?*

b.  *How many observations and variables does the dataset "anole.csv" have?*

c.  *What is the class of each variable in the dataset "anole.csv" (e.g.,
    character, factor, numeric, integer)?*


Other useful exploratory functions are ```levels()```, which returns the
unique values (levels) of a factor variable; ```summary()```, which
summarizes each variable in the dataset; ```head()```, which returns the
first rows in our dataset to explore the variables, and ```View()``` which
opens the dataset as a spreadsheet. Note that R language is
case-sensitive.

```r
# levels of the variable Sex, the $ sign means "within"
levels(anole$Sex)

# summary of each variable
summary(anole)

# first rows of anole
head(anole)

# viewing anole
View(anole)
```


### *Questions*

a.  *How many levels does the variable Sex have?*

b.  *What is the mean Femur length of "anole.csv"?*

c.  *What are the first three variables in "anole.csv"?*


### 6. Managing data

Many functions like ```str()``` come built into R. However, R packages
give you additional useful functions. You will be using some functions
from the package *tidyverse* to manage your data (e.g., filtering
columns, selecting columns). Before you use a package for the first time
you need to install it in R. After installation, you should load it
using ```library()``` in every subsequent R session as needed.

```r
# installing tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse",repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")

# loading tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```


Now, let's say you are interested only in the column "Femur" within
anole and you want to store such column in a new object named *femurs*.
To select columns of a data frame, use ```select()```. The first argument
in this function is the data object, and the subsequent argument is the
column to keep. Keep in min that ```select()``` is part of package
tidyverse.

```r
# selecting the column femur
femurs <- select(anole, Femur)

# checking the new object created
femurs
```


### *Questions*

a.  *Is the new object in the Global Environment?*


Now, say you are interested only in femurs of length higher than 10 mm.
To filter by row, use ```filter()```. The first argument in this function
is the data object, and the subsequent arguments are the column name and
the condition.

```r
# filtering femurs by femur length > 10mm
femurs_10mm <- filter(femurs, Femur>10)

# checking the new object created
femurs_10mm
```


### *Questions*

a.  *What's the longest femur length in femurs_10mm?*
b.  *How many observations does femurs_10mm have?*


### 7. Descriptive statistics

Finally, keep in mind that R is a language in which we can define our
own mathematical functions. Therefore, it also works as a calculator.
Let's employ descriptive stats functions for "Femur" in anole, including
```mean()```, ```median()```, ```min()```, ```max()```, and ```range()``` to
estimate the mean, median, minimum, maximum and range of femur length
values, respectively. Note the use of the ```\$``` sign!

```r
# mean femur length
mean(anole$Femur)

# median femur length
median(anole$Femur)

# minimum femur length
min(anole$Femur)
# max femur length
max(anole$Femur)

# range of values for femur length
range(anole$Femur)
```


### *Questions*

a.  *Do you get the same results from the summary() function?*


### Stop, Think, Do: 
Now, it is your turn to practice what we have done with dataset "lizards". **Stop**
and review the steps 1-7 you just did. **Think** about how you could
manipulate such codes in order to do the same analysis for "lizards".
**Do** the analysis and answer the questions! *Hint*: give an
appropriate name to the new objects you will create for "lizards". Such
names should not overwrite the ones used for "anole.csv" in your script. Do
the analysis and be ready to present it!


### Discussion questions

a.  *Now that you are more familiarized with RStudio, can you describe
    its layout including its four principal components (windows)?*
b.  *Mention three benefits of annotating your script.*
c.  *How do you set a path between R and the location of your files in
    your computer?*
d.  *Why would you use the str() function?*


**Great Work!**
