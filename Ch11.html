    <h1>Generalized Linear Models (GLM) - Chapter 11</h1>

    <h2>Case Study: Predicting Plant Growth under Different Watering Regimes</h2>
    <p>In this chapter, we will use Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to explore how different watering regimes affect the growth of a plant species. The case study investigates whether the amount of water (as a continuous variable) and the frequency of watering (as a categorical variable) influence plant growth (measured as plant height). This biological scenario involves two types of predictors: one quantitative and one categorical.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) provide a powerful framework for modeling biological data when the response variable is not normally distributed. Unlike traditional linear models, GLMs allow for response variables that follow different distributions such as binomial, Poisson, or Gaussian. The model is defined by three main components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Random Component</strong>: Specifies the distribution of the response variable (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson).</li>
        <li><strong>Systematic Component</strong>: A linear predictor, which is a linear combination of explanatory variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Link Function</strong>: A function that links the mean of the distribution to the linear predictor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the case of plant growth, the response variable is continuous (plant height) and we hypothesize that watering frequency and volume can significantly influence plant growth. We will use a Poisson distribution for count data (if plant height categories are used) or Gaussian distribution if we treat height as a continuous variable.</p>

    <h2>Formulating the GLM</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to model plant height (Y) as a function of two predictors: watering volume (X1) and watering frequency (X2). The GLM could be expressed as:</p>
    <pre>
        Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε
    </pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Y</strong> is the plant height (response variable).</li>
        <li><strong>X1</strong> is the amount of water applied (predictor, quantitative).</li>
        <li><strong>X2</strong> is the frequency of watering (predictor, categorical).</li>
        <li><strong>β0</strong>, <strong>β1</strong>, <strong>β2</strong> are model coefficients to be estimated.</li>
        <li><strong>ε</strong> is the error term.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of GLMs in Biological Studies</h2>
    <p>Depending on the nature of the response variable, we may use different types of GLMs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Poisson Distribution</strong>: Used for count data, such as counting the number of flowers per plant or plant deaths. This model uses a log link function.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaussian Distribution</strong>: Used for continuous data, such as the plant height we are examining in this case study. The identity link function is commonly used for continuous data.</li>
        <li><strong>Binomial Distribution</strong>: Used for binary outcomes (e.g., presence or absence of a disease), with the logit link function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applying GLMs: Modeling Plant Growth</h2>
    <p>Let's consider a biological experiment where we apply different watering volumes (low, medium, high) and frequencies (daily, every 3 days, weekly) to a plant species and measure the plant height after a set period. The data we collect includes both continuous (water volume) and categorical (watering frequency) predictors. We hypothesize that both factors will influence plant growth:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Null hypothesis (H0)</strong>: Water volume and frequency do not affect plant growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative hypothesis (H1)</strong>: Water volume and frequency significantly affect plant growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will use a GLM with a Gaussian distribution to model the continuous response (plant height). The link function will be the identity link, which assumes the response variable is linearly related to the predictors.</p>

    <h2>Estimating GLMs in R</h2>
    <p>To estimate the GLM, we can use R’s <code>glm()</code> function. The syntax is as follows:</p>
    <pre>
        model <- glm(Height ~ Water_Volume + Water_Frequency, family = gaussian(link = "identity"), data = plant_data)
    </pre>
    <p>This model fits plant height as a function of watering volume and frequency. We will examine the coefficients to determine the relationship between these variables and plant growth.</p>

    <h2>Interpreting GLM Output</h2>
    <p>The output from the GLM will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coefficients</strong>: Estimates for water volume and watering frequency, indicating their influence on plant height.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Errors</strong>: Measure of the variability in the coefficient estimates.</li>
        <li><strong>z-values and p-values</strong>: These statistics help us test the significance of each predictor in the model. A small p-value indicates that the corresponding predictor significantly affects plant height.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Model Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>To validate the GLM, we will conduct residual analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. These diagnostic checks ensure that the model appropriately represents the data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Residual Analysis</strong>: Plot the residuals to check for any patterns. Patterns might indicate that the linear assumption between predictors and response is not valid.</li>
        <li><strong>Goodness-of-Fit Test</strong>: Use tests such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or deviance to compare the fit of different models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: Estimating Watering Effects on Plant Height</h2>
    <p>For this case study, we will follow these steps in R:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Load the Data:</strong>
            <pre>
                plant_data <- read.csv("plant_growth.csv")
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fit the GLM:</strong>
            <pre>
                model <- glm(Height ~ Water_Volume + Water_Frequency, family = gaussian(link = "identity"), data = plant_data)
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Summarize the Model:</strong>
            <pre>
                summary(model)
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interpret the Coefficients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Positive coefficients indicate that increasing water volume or frequency increases plant height.</li>
                <li>Negative coefficients would suggest that more frequent watering reduces growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Checks:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Plot residuals to check if they exhibit any patterns.</li>
                <li>Assess model fit using AIC or deviance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Generalized Linear Models are a versatile tool for modeling various types of biological data. By applying GLMs to this plant growth case study, we were able to understand how different watering regimes influence plant height, considering both continuous and categorical predictors. The GLM framework provides the flexibility to handle complex biological data, making it an invaluable tool for ecological and experimental studies.</p>
