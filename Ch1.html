<h1>Introduction to R and RStudio</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

<div class="investigation" style="text-align: justify; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">
<p><strong>Today’s investigation.</strong> Transparency and reproducibility are key attributes of scientific
studies. In an effort to advance science across fields, primary
literature now needs to be accompanied by the data analyzed and the
analysis carried out. Because of this, <em>programming languages</em>
have become popular in science. They support easy work with data and
allow us to reproduce a statistical analysis in its entirety. Today, we
will explore the popular R programming language. We will be using R and
its integrated development environment, RStudio, to manage biological
data and address research questions with the goal to practice
transparency and reproducibility in statistical analyses.</p>
</div>

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #eee; margin: 5px 0 10px 0;">

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Introduction</h3>


<p>In this lab, we will introduce R, a <em>programming language</em> and
free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. First
developed in the 1990s, R has become a popular tool among biologists in
recent years and nearly an essential skill among biology students,
supporting national calls to promote and enhance quantitative literacy.
In particular, the popularity of R in biology is partly due to its
quality as a statistical software and its ability to manage large
datasets. Besides being free, one can contribute to new functions and
many other tools within R that can be shared with the public. One of
these developments is <em>RStudio</em>, an integrated development
environment for R that makes it easier to navigate certain aspects of
the language. So, let’s explore both R and RStudio and learn some of its
basic attributes and codes.</p>
<p><strong>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able
to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize with the layout of RStudio;</li>
<li>Import data to R using RStudio;</li>
<li>Identify the structure of a data object;</li>
<li>Manage a data object by selecting and filtering columns;</li>
<li>Create a reproducible lab report in R Markdown.</li>
</ul>

<div id="creating-and-setting-a-working-directory" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Creating and setting a working directory</h3>

<p>
In this course, you will primarily work in <strong>R Markdown (.Rmd)</strong> using a
<strong>class-provided template</strong>. When working in R Markdown, you generally
<strong>do not need to manually set a working directory</strong>. Instead, your
<code>.Rmd</code> file and your data files (for example, <code>anole.csv</code>) should
be saved in the <strong>same folder</strong>. R Markdown will then be able to find the
files automatically.
</p>

<p>
For this activity, create a folder on your computer named
<strong>working_directory</strong> (or another clearly named folder for this class or
week). Save the downloaded file <strong>anole.csv</strong> in this folder. This folder
will also be where you save your class template <code>.Rmd</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Although you will not usually set a working directory when using R Markdown,
it is important to understand how working directories function—especially
when working with regular <strong>R scripts (.R)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To manually set a working directory in RStudio:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Open RStudio. In the <strong>Files / Plots / Packages / Help</strong> pane
    (usually in the bottom-right), click the <strong>Files</strong> tab and navigate
    to your <strong>working_directory</strong> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once inside the folder, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> and select
    <strong>Set As Working Directory</strong>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Setting a working directory tells R where to look for files on
your computer. This step is typically unnecessary when using R Markdown, as
long as your <code>.Rmd</code> file and data files are stored in the same location.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Alternative method:</strong> You can also set the working directory by going
to <strong>Session</strong> &rarr; <strong>Set Working Directory</strong> &rarr;
<strong>Choose Directory...</strong>, and then selecting your
<strong>working_directory</strong> folder.
</p>
</div>

<div id="creating-and-saving-your-rmd" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Creating and saving your R Markdown file</h3>

<p>
In this course, you will complete your work using an
<strong>R Markdown (.Rmd)</strong> file, which combines R code, text, and output
in a single document. You will be provided with a
class template R Markdown file to use for this activity.
</p>

<p>
Open the class template <code>.Rmd</code> file in RStudio and immediately
<strong>save it</strong> in your <strong>working_directory</strong> folder (the same folder
that contains <code>anole.csv</code>). Use a clear and informative file name.
</p>

<p>
As you work, you can click the <strong>Knit</strong> button at the top of the editor
to preview how your document will look when rendered. Knitting allows you
to check that your code runs correctly and that your text, figures, and
tables appear as expected.
</p>

<p>
Later in the course, you will knit your completed R Markdown files to
<strong>PDF format</strong> for submission. For now, think of knitting as a way to
frequently preview and troubleshoot your work.
</p>
</div>


<div id="annotating-your-r-script" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Annotating your R Markdown file</h3>

<p>
Annotating your work is a very important step that helps you keep track of
your analysis and makes your work reproducible. In this course, your
<strong>R Markdown (.Rmd)</strong> file serves as your lab notebook.
</p>

<p>
An R Markdown file contains two main components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>R code chunks</strong>, where your R code is written and executed
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Markdown text</strong>, where you write explanations, titles,
    captions, and interpretations of results
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Annotating an R Markdown file therefore happens in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Inside R code chunks:</strong> Use <code>#</code> to add brief comments
    that explain what the code is doing. These comments are for clarifying
    specific lines or blocks of code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Outside R code chunks:</strong> Use regular text written in Markdown
    to provide longer explanations, section headers, figure captions, and
    interpretations of results.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, inside a code chunk you might write:
</p>

<pre class="r"><code># Load the anole dataset
anole &lt;- read.csv("anole.csv")</code></pre>

<p>
Outside of code chunks, you might add a section header or description such as:
</p>

<pre><code># Chapter 1: Intro to R and RStudio

In this section, we load the dataset and begin exploring its structure.</code></pre>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> In R code chunks, <code>#</code> indicates a comment.
Outside of code chunks, <code>#</code> indicates a header in Markdown. Be sure
you are typing in the appropriate location.
</p>

<p>
Click the <strong>Knit</strong> button frequently to check how your document is
rendering and to ensure that your code, text, and annotations appear as
expected.
</p>
</div>

<div id="installing-and-loading-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Installing and loading packages</h3>
<p>R uses packages to add new tools and functions.
In this course, we will use the tidyverse package.</p>
<h4>Installing a package</h4>
<p>You only need to install a package one time per computer.

In the Console in RStudio (not in a script or R Markdown file), run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="importing-data-files-to-r-using-rstudio" class="section level3">
<p>Do not include install.packages() inside an R Markdown file that you will knit and submit.
Installation only needs to happen once.</p>
<h4>Loading a package</h4>
<p>Each time you start working in R, you must load the packages you want to use.

At the top of your script or R Markdown file, run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>This makes tidyverse functions (such as filter(), mutate(), and the pipe operator %>%) available for use.

If you see an error like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>could not find function "filter"</code></pre>
<p>it usually means the package has not been loaded.</p>
<h3>5. Importing data files to R using RStudio</h3>
<p>There are several ways to import data to R using RStudio and it
depends on the type of file the data is (i.e., .csv, .RData). You may
use the one that works best for you. Below are three ways to import
data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A. Importing a .csv file using the RStudio drop down
menu</strong>: In the Flies/Plots/Packages/Help window of RStudio, click
File and search for your working_directory folder. Once there, click on
the anole.csv file and import it using the drop down menu. If it worked,
you should see “anole.csv” in the RStudio Global Environment
window.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B. Importing a .csv file using codes</strong>: After
setting up your working directory (Step 1), use the function
<code>read.csv()</code> to import the anole.csv file. See the example
below. Note the use of the commands <code>header=TRUE</code> in order to
treat the first row of the data frame as a header and
<code>stringsASFactors=TRUE</code> to indicate that strings in the data
frame should be treated as factor variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># importing the anole data
anole &lt;- read.csv(&quot;anole.csv&quot;,header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>To run the line of codes, copy it and paste it in your R script. You
may highlight it and click “Run”, which is located in the upper side of
the script. If it worked, you should see the line of codes in your
console and “anole.csv” in the RStudio Global Environment window.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C. Using an .RData file</strong>: If the data file is an R
object (file extension = .RData), right click it and open it with
RStudio. If it worked, you should see “anole.csv” in the RStudio Global
Environment window.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exploring-the-imported-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Exploring the imported dataset</h3>
<p>Before any analysis, we first need to check the data and understand
its attributes.</p>
<p>Let’s start looking into the structure of “anole.csv” by using the
function <code>str()</code>. This function gives us information about
the <em>class</em> of the data object (i.e., “anole.csv”), what
<em>variables</em> are in the data object, and how many
<em>observations</em> we have in the data object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># data structure
str(anole)</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Formatting questions in your R Markdown (.Rmd) report</strong></p>
<p>In this course, format each question as a header in your .Rmd file, and then write your answer as plain text immediately below it. You do not have to re-type the full question, but including it is recommended so your report is easy to understand later without needing to look back at the lab manual.</p>

<pre><code>## Question Set 1: Descriptive title

### Question 1a
*Optional: write the question text here.*

Write your answer here as plain text. You can include R code chunks, figures,
and brief interpretation as needed.

### Question 1b
*Optional: write the question text here.*

Write your answer here.</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<div id="question-set-1">
<h3><em>Question Set 1</em></h3>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 1.2em;">
    <li><p>
      <strong>1a.</strong>
      <em>What is the class of the dataset “anole.csv” (e.g., data frame, table, tibble)?</em>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>1b.</strong>
      <em>How many observations and variables does the dataset “anole.csv” have?</em>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>1c.</strong>
      <em>What is the class of each variable in the dataset “anole.csv” (e.g., character, factor, numeric, integer)?</em>
   </p> </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p><br></p>

<p>Other useful exploratory functions are <code>levels()</code>, which
returns the unique values (levels) of a factor variable;
<code>summary()</code>, which summarizes each variable in the dataset;
<code>head()</code>, which returns the first rows in our dataset to
explore the variables, and <code>View()</code> which opens the dataset
as a spreadsheet. Note that R language is case-sensitive.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># levels of the variable Sex, the $ sign means &quot;within&quot;, or in other words the column
levels(anole$Sex)

# summary of each variable
summary(anole)

# first rows of anole
head(anole)

# viewing anole
View(anole)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="question-set-2">
<h3><em>Question Set 2</em></h3>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 1.2em;">
    <li><p>
      <strong>2a.</strong>
      <em>How many levels does the variable Sex have?</em>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>2b.</strong>
      <em>What is the mean Femur length of “anole.csv”?</em>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>2c.</strong>
      <em>What are the first three variables in “anole.csv”?</em>
   </p> </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p><br></p>

<div id="managing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>7. Managing data</h3>

<p>Many functions, such as <code>str()</code>, come built into R. However, additional
functionality is provided through R packages. In this course, you will use
functions from the <em>tidyverse</em> package to manage and manipulate data
(e.g., selecting and filtering columns).</p>

<p><strong>Installing and loading packages in R Markdown</strong></p>
<p>You only need to <strong>install</strong> a package once on your computer. Do this
by running the installation command in the <strong>Console</strong> (not inside an
.Rmd code chunk). In your R Markdown document, you should then
<strong>load</strong> the package using <code>library()</code> in the first (or an early)
code chunk so it is available for the rest of the report.</p>

<pre class="r"><code># run this ONCE in the Console (not in an .Rmd code chunk)
install.packages("tidyverse")

<pre class="r"><code># load tidyverse (after installing it in the Console)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>

<p>Now, suppose you are interested only in the column <code>Femur</code> from the
dataset <code>anole</code>, and you want to store this column in a new object named
<em>femurs</em>. To select columns from a data frame, use the
<code>select()</code> function. The first argument is the data object, and the second
argument specifies the column(s) to keep. Note that <code>select()</code> is part
of the <em>tidyverse</em>.</p>

<pre class="r"><code># selecting the Femur column
femurs &lt;- select(anole, Femur)

# checking the new object
femurs</code></pre>
</div>

<div id="question-set-3">
<h3><em>Question Set 3</em></h3>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 1.2em;">
    <li><p>
      <strong>3a.</strong>
      <em>Is the new object in the Global Environment?</em>
    </p></li>

<p><br></p>

Now, say you are interested only in femurs of length higher than 10
mm. To filter by row, use <code>filter()</code>. The first argument in
this function is the data object, and the subsequent arguments are the
column name and the condition.

<pre class="r"><code># filtering femurs by femur length &gt; 10mm
femurs_10mm &lt;- filter(femurs, Femur&gt;10)

# checking the new object created
femurs_10mm</code></pre>
</div>

<div id="question-set-4">
<h3><em>Question Set 4</em></h3>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 1.2em;">
    <li><p>
      <strong>4a.</strong>
      <em>What’s the longest femur length in femurs_10mm?</em>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>4b.</strong>
      <em>How many observations does femurs_10mm have?</em>
    </p></li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p><br></p>

<div id="descriptive-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>8. Descriptive statistics</h3>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that R is a language in which we can define our
own mathematical functions. Therefore, it also works as a calculator.
Let’s employ descriptive stats functions for “Femur” in anole, including
<code>mean()</code>, <code>median()</code>, <code>min()</code>,
<code>max()</code>, and <code>range()</code> to estimate the mean,
median, minimum, maximum and range of femur length values, respectively.
Note the use of the <code>\$</code> sign!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># mean femur length
mean(anole$Femur)

# median femur length
median(anole$Femur)

# minimum femur length
min(anole$Femur)
# max femur length
max(anole$Femur)

# range of values for femur length
range(anole$Femur)</code></pre>
</div>


<div id="question-set-5">
<h3><em>Question Set 5</em></h3>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 1.2em;">
    <li><p>
      <strong>5a.</strong>
      <em>Do you get the same results from the <code>summary()</code> function?</em>
    </p></li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p><br></p>

<div id="stop-think-do" class="section level3">
<h3>Stop, Think, Do:</h3>
<p>Now, it is your turn to practice what we have done with dataset
“lizards”. <strong>Stop</strong> and review the steps 1-7 you just did.
<strong>Think</strong> about how you could manipulate such codes in
order to do the same analysis for “lizards”. <strong>Do</strong> the
analysis and answer the questions! <em>Hint</em>: give an appropriate
name to the new objects you will create for “lizards”. Such names should
not overwrite the ones used for “anole.csv” in your script. Do the
analysis and be ready to present it!</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><em>Now that you are more familiarized with RStudio, can you
describe its layout including its four principal components
(windows)?</em></li>
<li><em>Mention three benefits of annotating your script.</em></li>
<li><em>How do you set a path between R and the location of your files
in your computer?</em></li>
<li><em>Why would you use the str() function?</em></li>
</ol>

<div id="knitting-your-rmd" class="section level3">
<h3>8. How to knit your R Markdown document</h3>

<p>
Once you have written some code and added text to your
<code>.Rmd</code> file, you can “<strong>knit</strong>” the document to
produce a formatted output (usually PDF in this course). Knitting runs all
of your R code, captures the results, and combines them with your text into
a polished document.
</p>

<p>
To knit your document:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure your R Markdown file is the active tab in RStudio.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <strong>Knit</strong> button near the top of the editor (it
    looks like a ball of yarn with a knitting needle).
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the output format if prompted (for this course, choose
    <strong>PDF</strong>).
  </li>
  <li>
    RStudio will run your code chunks in order and generate a new
    document that shows both your text and the results of your code.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
If there are errors in your code, RStudio will stop knitting and show you
messages that explain what went wrong. Use those messages to fix issues in
your R code or text and then try knitting again.
</p>

<p>
Knit your document often as you work. This helps you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Catch coding mistakes early</li>
  <li>See whether your plots and tables look the way you expect</li>
  <li>Confirm that your explanations are clear and properly formatted</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will eventually turn in a knitted PDF version of your lab, so getting
comfortable with knitting now will make later assignments smoother.
</p>
